CRUD-.NET
CRUD-.NET is a .NET-based project designed to demonstrate Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. This repository emphasizes clean code principles, modular design, and maintainable development practices. Core functionality is implemented in C#, 
Features
Robust C# Implementation: Built with .NET, following modern software development practices like dependency injection, unit testing, and separation of concerns.
Modular and Scalable: Designed to be extensible, making it easy to adapt or integrate into other projects.

Key Concepts and Best Practices
Separation of Concerns: Logic is divided into layers (e.g., controllers, services, models) for better maintainability.
Dependency Injection: Inversion of control is used to decouple components, making the codebase more testable and reusable.
Unit Testing: Tests are located in the tests/ directory to ensure the application remains robust and bug-free.
